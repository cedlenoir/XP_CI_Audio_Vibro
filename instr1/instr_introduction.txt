There will be 12 "feeling" trials followed by 5 tapping trials.


During feeling trials, please instruct the participant to:

	1. Actively sense and enjoy the vibration as in the familiarization trial.

	2. Prevent any movement synchronised with the rhythm
	   (e.g. air-tapping their toes).

	3. Relax, sit back and keep their eyes fixated on the fixation cross when the vibration is on.


During TAPPING trials, please instruct the participant to:

	1. Tap the finger of their preferred hand on the tapping box.

	2. They should try to tap the steady pulse of rhythm, similar to tapping their foot or bobbing their head to music. 

	3. Keep their eyes fixated on a point when the vibration is on.
