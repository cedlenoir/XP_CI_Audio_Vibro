There will be 12 listening trials followed by 5 tapping trials.


During listening trials, please instruct the participant to:

	1.  Pay attention and enjoy the sound.

	2. Prevent any movement synchronised with the rhythm
	   (e.g. air-tapping their toes).

	3. Relax, sit back and keep their eyes fixated on the fixation cross when the sound is on.


During TAPPING trials, please instruct the participant to:

	1. Tap the finger of their preferred hand on the tapping box.

	2. They should try to tap the steady pulse of rhythm, similar to tapping their foot or bobbing their head to music. 

	3. Keep their eyes fixated on a point when the sound is on.
